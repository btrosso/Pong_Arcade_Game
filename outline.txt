#    ***Breaking Down the Problem*** - My first attempt 
#    * create two paddles
#    -- create the paddles
#    -- move the paddles to starting positions
#    * move the paddles
#    -- have the paddles move independently
#    -- have them stop at the limits of the game screen
#    * control the paddles using the keyboard
#    -- set up the paddles to use keyboard input to move up and down
#    * create pong ball (moves along a trajectory)
#    -- create a single pong ball turtle
#    -- have the ball move
#    * create a score board and center dotted line
#    -- create turtle to write score (may need two separate turtles depending on how the animation works (i.e. if it looks laggy)
#    * detect collision with paddle
#    -- detect when the pong ball collides with the paddles
#    -- move pong ball along some other trajectory after collision with paddle
#    * detect passing the paddle
#    -- detect whether or not the pong ball has passed the paddle
#   -- if so end the current round and update the scoreboard and set up the next round
#    -- game goes to 10?
#    
#    * some way to end the game (play till what?
